# World-Weather-Analysis

## Overview of Project
I built the PlanMyTrip app to pull weather data for a list of randomly generated cities, including cloudiness, wind, max temperature, and a description of the current weather.
Users can input a minimum and maximum temperature, which will narrow down the list of cities to only those that fall within those preferred temperature criteria. The app will then find nearby hotels in each of those recommended cities. To exemplify how the app can be used to create a travel itinerary, I chose four cities in Indonesia that I would like to visit. The app then provided me with a Google Maps travel route and a marker layer app identifying the pertinent information for each city I plan to visit.
